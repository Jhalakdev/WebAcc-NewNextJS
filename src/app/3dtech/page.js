                <h1>Augmented Reality (AR)</h1>
                <p>Augmented Reality involves overlaying digital information onto the real world using devices like smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses. AR enhances the user&apos;s perception of reality by adding digital elements such as images, videos, or 3D models to their view. It allows users to interact with virtual objects in a real environment.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Applications of AR:</h3>
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Retail and E-commerce:</strong>AR can enable customers to virtually try on clothing, accessories, or furniture before making a purchase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Education:</strong>AR can make learning interactive by providing additional information or visual aids when scanning textbooks or educational materials.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Real Estate:</strong>AR can be used to visualize properties by superimposing virtual furniture or designs onto physical spaces.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Gaming:</strong>AR gaming apps like Pok√©mon GO use the real world as a playground for virtual elements and interactions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Healthcare:</strong>AR can assist medical professionals during surgery by overlaying diagnostic information on a patient&apos;s body.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Virtual Reality (VR)</h1>
                <p>Virtual Reality immerses users in a completely digital environment using headsets or VR glasses. VR isolates users from the physical world and provides them with a 360-degree, computer-generated experience. This technology is particularly effective for creating highly immersive simulations and training scenarios.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Applications of VR:</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    <strong>Gaming:</strong> VR gaming provides users with a fully immersive experience, making them feel like they&apos;re inside the game.<br />
                    <strong>Training and Simulation:</strong> Industries like aviation, medicine, and military use VR for realistic training scenarios without real-world risks.<br />
                    <strong>Architecture and Design:</strong> VR enables architects and designers to walk through virtual buildings before construction begins.<br />
                    <strong>Tourism and Entertainment:</strong> VR can transport users to distant locations, historical periods, or fictional worlds.<br />
                    <strong>Therapy and Rehabilitation:</strong> VR is used for exposure therapy and physical rehabilitation, providing controlled environments for treatment.

                <h1>Mixed Reality (MR):</h1>
                <p>
                    Mixed Reality combines elements of both AR and VR to create experiences where digital and physical objects coexist and interact in real time. MR often requires specialized headsets that allow users to see and manipulate both the virtual and physical environments simultaneously.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Applications of MR:</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    <strong>Industrial Design:</strong> MR can aid in designing and prototyping products by visualizing virtual elements in real-world contexts.<br />
                    <strong>Remote Collaboration:</strong> MR can enable users in different locations to collaborate on projects by sharing virtual objects and annotations.<br />
                    <strong>Field Service:</strong> MR can provide technicians with real-time information and instructions while working on machinery or equipment.<br />
                    <strong>Training and Education:</strong> MR offers hands-on training experiences where users can interact with virtual objects in their physical surroundings.<br />
                    <strong>Interactive Presentations:</strong> MR can enhance presentations by allowing presenters to manipulate 3D models and data in real time.
